# Make GitHub Great Again

This chrome extension detects when you're switching between the Conversations / Commits / Checks / Files changed pages on a GitHub PR, and reloads the browser tab instead of waiting for GitHub's cursed SPA to render the new page.

Switching between pages while reviewing a GitHub PR is painfully slow. As in, it's faster to refresh the browser tab. This is bizarre, because GitHub is a single page app (SPA), and premably the only reason people make SPAs is because can switch between pages faster. This is very cursed.
